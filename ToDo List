Wild Sorceror Wild Surge:
Replace Wild Magic Surge with Building Surge: Wild magic energy builds inside you and then is released when you use magic. When you cast a spell of level 1 or higher, add the spell's level to your Building Surge total. Then roll a d20, adding your Building Surge total to the roll. On a result of 20 or higher, roll on the Wild Magic table to create a random magical effect, and then reset your Building Surge total to 0.
Modify Tides of Chaos: Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
When you use this feature, add 10 points to your Building Surge total. After you trigger a Building Surge, you regain the use of this feature.

//New Feat for Light Armour
Light Armor Master:
Your Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
While wearing light armor, when an attack against you fails or you succeed on a dexterity saving throw against an enemy ability, you may use your reaction to move 5 feet in any direction without provoking opportunity attacks.
Makes you better at running and harder to lock down, lets you duck away from arrows too. No help at all though for standing your ground. Also lets you flank an opponent and back off when they turn on you, leaving them unable to continue attacking without risking opportunity attacks from your ally. 

Smokepowder:
Use smokepowder instead of gunpowder. Come up with ingredients for how to make it. Allow guns to use Fire Crystals too instead of smokepowder, maybe magic guns will use them.
